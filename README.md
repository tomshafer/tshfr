# R Utilities

This package bundles up a collection of R tools for data science and other
analysis, including utility functions, PDF templates, and [ggplot2][] themes.
Some of these I've dreamed up or needed [at work][eri].

## Installation

I don't really intend to ever put this onto CRAN, but it's easily installed
using the [remotes][] package:

```r
remotes::install_github("tomshafer/tshfr")
```

[ggplot2]: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org
[remotes]: https://remotes.r-lib.org
[eri]: https://www.elderresearch.com/
